    <p>WhatsApp was founded in February 2009 by <mark>Brian Acton and Jan Koum</mark>, former employees of Yahoo!. A month earlier, after Koum purchased an iPhone, he and Acton decided to create an app for the App Store. The idea started off as an app that would display statuses in a phone's Contacts menu, showing if a person was at work or on a call.In March, WhatsApp partnered with the World Health Organization and UNICEF to provide messaging hotlines for people to get information on the 2019â€“2020 coronavirus pandemic.In the same month WhatsApp began testing a feature to help users find out more information and context about information they receive to help combat misinformation.
